#### RELINTEL-LIBRARY Usage

import relintel

#Import specific modules as needed (e.g., relintel.video, relintel.keyboard)

Utilize functionalities:

Relintel Library provides various functionalities for data acquisition and analysis. Here's a basic example:

# Capture video and keyboard data
video_data, keyboard_data = relintel.capture_data(duration_seconds=10)

# Analyze data and retrieve identity score
identity_score = relintel.analyze_data(video_data, keyboard_data)

# Access control logic based on identity score
if identity_score > 0.8:
    print("Access granted")
else:
    print("Access denied")
